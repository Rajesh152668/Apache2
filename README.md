You should use the httpd base image when you need to deploy a web application that uses the Apache HTTP Server.
Google Docs, Gmail, Facebook, Twitter, Amazon, and Netflix are some of examples of web application

Apache HTTP Server is a free, open-source web server that is widely used across the world. It's part of the LAMP stack (Linux, Apache, MySQL, PHP), and is one of the most-used web servers because it's easy to use and doesn't require much configuration.
Here are some websites that use Apache HTTP Server:
Adobe.com, Netflix.com, Spotify.com, Digicert.com, Ntp.org, Nih.gov, Samsung.com, and Theguardian.com

Here are some specific scenarios where using the httpd base image might be appropriate:
1.Static websites: If your web application consists primarily of static HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files, the httpd image is a good choice. Apache is well-suited for serving static content efficiently.
Common examples of static websites include resume websites, portfolio websites, brochure websites, one-off landing pages, and other informational or read-only sites. These websites are small (three to four pages or fewer), limited in content, and don't require personalized content or frequent updates.
2.PHP applications: If your application is written in PHP, using the httpd image with a PHP module installed can be a convenient way to deploy and run your application.
3.Custom configurations: If you need to customize Apache's configuration for your specific needs, the httpd base image gives you full control over the server's settings.

Here are some advantages of using the httpd base image:
Widely used: Apache is one of the most popular web servers, so there is a large community and extensive documentation available.
Efficient: Apache is known for its performance and scalability.
